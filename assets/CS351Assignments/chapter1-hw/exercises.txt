Chapter 1 Excersises 
--------------------------------
1.)I personally already host a website through AWS EC2. 
   That is Amazons web services and it works perfectly for what I need.
   It is cheap and easy to set up, and has the ability to be expanded to gtow as my needs do.
   
2.) The top 3 mobile browsers are (in descending order): Chrome, Safari, and Samsung Internet.
    
3.)	https is the hypertext transfer protocol secure, and it is a set of rules and formats for
	computers to exchange messages.
	mars is the web server that stores the web page.
	jpl.nasa.gov is the domain that says how to find the web server on the Internet.
	msl/images is the breadcrumbs, path or the sequence for where the current web page is saved on the web server.
	PIA16082_Mitrofanov1F-thm.jpg is the picture being served.
	
4.) A container tag or just a container has an opening and a closing tag, and contains information between its two tags.
	A void tag is just one tag, and it stores its information within itself.

5.) <!DOCTYPE html> tells the browser what type of document is being served.

6.) the closing </strong> tag ends after the closing </p> tag.
	It should go: 	<body>
						<p>
							I hate when I'm studying and a velociraptor throws bananas at me.
							Does that happen to anyone else?
							<strong>I hope not!</strong>
						</p>
					</body>

7.)	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<title> Ernesto Sabatoâ€™s On Heroes and Tombs </title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p lang="es">
			La vanidad es tan fantastica, que hasta nos induce a preocuparnos de lo que pensaran de
			nosotros una vez muertos y enterrados.
		</p>
	</body>
	</html>
	

8.) The <p></p> tags are a container of groups of words meant to form paragraphs.
	The text within a p tag will be rendered between a blank line above and below it.
	
	The <div></div> tags can also contain a group of text but in a more generic way.
	They do not have to form sentences in a paragraph.
	
	We use p tags when we want to form a coherent paragraph, and div tags when we want to group things together but do not need a proper paragraph.
	

9.) Ian Hickson is the author of the WHATWG HTML5 specification, and a co-editor for the CSS 2.1 specification.

10.) -	<strong>is for to bold the text it contains</strong> 
	 -  <em>makes the text it contains italic</em>
	 -  <sub>makes the text it contains a subscript<sub>
	 - 	<sup>makes the text it contains a superscript<sup>

11.) Error: Element h7 not allowed as child of element body in this context. (Suppressing further errors from this subtree.)
     Error: End tag for body seen, but there were unclosed elements.
	 Error: Unclosed element h7.
